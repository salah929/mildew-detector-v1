    "**Protecting Cherry Crops:**\n"
    "Powdery mildew is a common fungal disease that can significantly "
    "reduce cherry yield and quality. Early detection enables farmers to "
    "act promptly and prevent the spread of infection.\n\n"

    "**Targeted Intervention:**\n"
    "With early and accurate identification, treatment can be applied "
    "selectively, minimizing the use of fungicides and reducing "
    "environmental impact.\n\n"

    "**Cost Reduction and Sustainability:**\n"
    "Automated detection systems reduce labor costs associated with "
    "manual inspections, improve decision-making, and support sustainable "
    "farming practices through smart resource usage.\n\n"

    "**Scalability and Digital Agriculture:**\n"
    "Machine learning solutions like this can be scaled to other crops "
    "and regions, enabling data-driven agriculture and supporting food "
